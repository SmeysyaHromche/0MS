University project for 0MS(Math Software).

## Description

This project demonstrates the application of simple linear regression using a dataset that relates apartment sizes to their corresponding prices in Moscow. The practical implementation leverages Python's Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. By analyzing this dataset, the project aims to illustrate the fundamental principles of linear regression and its ability to predict prices based on the size of apartments. Through visualization and statistical analysis, users can gain insights into how linear regression models work and their potential utility in real-world scenarios, particularly in the context of property pricing.
