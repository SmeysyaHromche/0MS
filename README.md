University project for 0MS(Math Software).

## Description

This project demonstrates the application of simple linear regression and ordinary least squere using with real data. The practical implementation leverages Python's Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. By analyzing this dataset, the project aims to illustrate the fundamental principles of regression and its ability to prediction.
